The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) is a twelve-channel, six-frequency, total power passive-microwave radiometer system.
Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) is one of the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) instruments on board the European Space Agency (ESA) satellite ENVISAT.
It is the most recent in a series of instruments designed primarily to measure Sea Surface Temperature (SST), following on from ATSR-1 and ATSR-2 on board ERS-1 and ERS-2.
The Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI)  has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels.
Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.

Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Datasets
Aqua is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
Envisat, is an advanced polar-orbiting Earth observation satellite which provides measurements of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice.
Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) provides multi-spectral imagery of the Earth's surface and cloud systems from a geostationary orbit.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.

A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on an operational basis at  Ifremer/CERSAT (France)  using optimal interpolation (OI) on a regional 0.02 degree grid.
It provides a daily cloud-free field of foundation sea surface temperature at approximately 2 km resolution (0.02 degree) for the Mediterranean Sea.
It is generated by merging microwave and infrared satellite sea surface temperature observations including those from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) and  the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager.
The satellite SST observations are  intercalibrated using the AATSR sensor as a reference (previously re-calibrated using all available in situ data).
The development of the global real-time sea surface temperature at Ifremer/CERSAT is supported by European Commission initially in the frame of MERSEA project.
This dataset supersedes the original Level 4 product for this region: GHRSST Level 4 EUR Mediterranean Sea Regional Foundation Sea Surface Temperature Analysis.
