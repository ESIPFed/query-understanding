Rapid Scatterometer
The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-purpose habitable spacecraft in low-earth orbit.
The ISS-RapidScat instrument is a speedy and cost-effective replacement for NASA's QuikScat Earth satellite, which monitored ocean winds to provide essential measurements used in weather predictions, including hurricane monitoring.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains the ISS-RapidScat on Level 2A 25km science data record, which provides surface-flagged sigma-0 in 25km Wind Vector Cells processed using the pulse "egg" Sigma-0 data provided by the Level 1B dataset.
Due to the circular scan of the SeaWinds instrument the expected number of Sigma-0 cells per WVC is not constant.
To minimize the L2A data volume, the Sigma-0 cell data are stored as "lists" for each WVC row, with each list indexed by a "cell_index" array to indicate the cross-track WVC membership of the data.
Each cell is then checked for land or ice and flagged accordingly.
Attenuation corrections for each Sigma-0 measurement are also provided.
Data are provided in single-orbit files in HDF-4 format.
RapidScat is a Ku-band dual beam circular rotating scatterometer retaining much of the same hardware and functionality of QuikSCAT, with exception of the antenna sub-system and digital interface to the International Space Station (ISS) Columbus module, which is where RapidScat is mounted.
The NASA mission is officially referred to as ISS-RapidScat.
Unlike QuikSCAT, ISS-RapidScat is not in sun-synchronous orbit, and flies at roughly half the altitude with a low inclination angle that restricts data coverage to the tropics and mid-latitude regions; the extent of latitudinal coverage stretches from approximately 56 degrees North to 56 degrees South.
Furthermore, there is no consistent local time of day retrieval.
Text file containing reverse chronological list of future scheduled outages and past outages. A start/stop date/time and description is provided for each outage. This list is maintained by NOAA/NESDIS to service near-real-time data users.
Detailed background information on the ISS-RapidScat mission published by the eoPortal.
ASCII CSV orbital revolution time tables with quality assurance information.
