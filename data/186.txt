SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT mission is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997.
The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains GIF images of global, rectangular-gridded, daily averaged Sigma-0 retrievals from SeaWinds on QuikSCAT retrievals, which are generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU).
The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively.
The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized.
The GIF image files are separated according to polarization, and the averaged Sigma-0 measurements are displayed in grayscale with no color bar.
Very bright areas indicate high Sigma-0 averages.
It should be noted that these GIF images are meant for browse purposes only and should not be considered science quality.
The science quality source dataset containing the SIR files used to generate the GIF images is accessible here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_GLOBAL_RECTANGULAR_BROWSE_MAPS_LITE.
An additional complimentary dataset of SIR files contains the full daily Sigma-0 statistcs: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_GLOBAL_RECTANGULAR_BROWSE_MAPS_FULL.
This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.
