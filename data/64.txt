Rapid Scatterometer
The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-purpose habitable spacecraft in low-earth orbit.
The ISS-RapidScat instrument is a speedy and cost-effective replacement for NASA's QuikScat Earth satellite, which monitored ocean winds to provide essential measurements used in weather predictions, including hurricane monitoring.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains the geo-located Sigma-0 measurements and antenna pulse  "egg" and "slice" geometries as derived from ephemeris and the Level 1A dataset.
The pulse "egg" represents the complete footprint of the pulse, which has a spatial geometry of approximately 25 km by 35 km.
There are 8 slices that constitute the range-binned components of a pulse each of which has a spatial geometry of approximately 25 km by 7 km.
The orientation of the long dimension of the slices varies with the rotation of the antenna and thus does not align with the along/across track orientation of the wind vector grid in the L2B/L2A products.
Data are provided in single-orbit files in HDF-4 format.
RapidScat is a Ku-band dual beam circular rotating scatterometer retaining much of the same hardware and functionality of QuikSCAT, with exception of the antenna sub-system and digital interface to the International Space Station (ISS) Columbus module, which is where RapidScat is mounted.
The NASA mission is officially referred to as ISS-RapidScat.
Unlike QuikSCAT, ISS-RapidScat is not in sun-synchronous orbit, and flies at roughly half the altitude with a low inclination angle that restricts data coverage to the tropics and mid-latitude regions; the extent of latitudinal coverage stretches from approximately 56 degrees North to 56 degrees South.
Furthermore, there is no consistent local time of day retrieval.
Caution: this dataset is intended for expert use only.
If you must use RapidScat Sigma-0 data but you are unsure about how to use the L1B data record, please consider using either of the following L2A datasets: 1) http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/RSCAT_L2A_12KM_V1.1 or 2) http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/RSCAT_L2A_25KM_V1.1.
Detailed background information on the ISS-RapidScat mission published by the eoPortal.
ASCII CSV orbital revolution time tables with quality assurance information.
Text file containing reverse chronological list of future scheduled outages and past outages. A start/stop date/time and description is provided for each outage. This list is maintained by NOAA/NESDIS to service near-real-time data users.
