Nadir pointing radar altimeter measuring at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 3.2 GHz (S band) The Poseidon-2 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the JASON-1 mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionospheric correction.
The Poseidon-2 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.
The JMR mreasures teh sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz and 34.0 GHz) to provide the total water vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement and is a redundant channel on the JMR.
The 18.7 GHz channel provides a correction for wind-induced effects in the sea surface background emissions, and the 34.0 GHz channel provides a correction for cloud liquid water.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.
A satellite altimeter consists of a transmitter that sends out very sharp pulses, a sensitive receiver to record the pulse after it is reflected from the sea surface, and an accurate clock to note the time interval between transmission and reception.
Examples of satellite altimeters used in the remote sensing of ocean surface height,  wave height and wind speed are Seasat, Geosat and Topex/Poseidon.

The TMR measures the sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18 GHz, 21 GHz and 37 GHz) to provide the total water-vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 21 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement.
It is redundant (21A and 21B).
The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover, respectively in the water-vapor measurement.
TMR data are sent to CNES for processing along with their altimeter data.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.

Examples of satellite altimeters used in the remote sensing of ocean surface height,  wave height and wind speed are Seasat, Geosat and Topex/Poseidon.
Radar Altimeter (RA) provides accurate measurements of sea surface elevation, significant wave heights, various ice parameters and an estimate of sea surface wind speed.
The Poseidon-3 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the OSTM mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionoshperic correction.
The Poseidon-3 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.
The accelerometer, located at the center of mass of each satellite, measures all non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite.
These forces include air drag, solar radiation pressure, and attitude control activator operation.
The two star cameras mounted close to the accelerometer on each satellite provide
the precise attitude references for the satellites when making science
measurements.
This instrument precisely measures the changes in the separation between the two GRACE satellites using phase tracking of K- and Ka-band signals sent between the two satellites

This dataset contains absolute dynamic topography (similar to sea level but with respect to the geoid) binned and averaged monthly on 1 degree grids.
The coverage is from October 1992 to December 2010.
These data were provided by AVISO (French space agency data provider) to support the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was first made available via the JPL Earth System Grid.
The dynamic topography are derived from sea surface height measured by several satellites including Envisat, TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2, and referenced to the geoid.
Along with this dataset, two additional ancillary data files are included in the same directory which contain the number of observations and standard error co-located on the same 1 degree grids.
