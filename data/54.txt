Quick Scatterometer
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

Quick Scatterometer
The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT mission is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997.
The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains 0.25 degree gridded ocean surface wind vector fields from the NASA SeaWinds scatterometer aboard the QuikSCAT satellite platform.
Gridded wind vector fields are provided twice daily daily according to the timing of the ascending and descending satellite swath coverage; where multiple swaths from a particular ascending or descending sample period intersect a given point, the the data from the most recent swath coverage over-writes the data from the earlier (adjacent) swath.
Quality flags are provided for each wind vector cell to assist in identifying potential rain contamination and whether data from both inner and outer beams are available.
Wind vectors are null when within 30 km of land/ice boundaries or where there are no wind vector retrievals available.
Gridded wind vector fields are processed directly from the QuikSCAT Level 2B swath data which uses the QSCAT-1 geophysical model function.
No additional processing to the wind vector data is applied.
The SeaWinds instrument is a conical scanning pencil-beam radar, with dual-beam and dual-polarization capability, operating at Ku-band to provide all-weather ocean surface wind vector retrievals.
This represents the 2nd version of the Level 3 processing.

Disclaimer: this dataset is meant for quick-look purposes only and is not intended for science-quality research applications.
