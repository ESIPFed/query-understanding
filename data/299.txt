TOPEX/Poseidon
A satellite altimeter consists of a transmitter that sends out very sharp pulses, a sensitive receiver to record the pulse after it is reflected from the sea surface, and an accurate clock to note the time interval between transmission and reception.
Examples of satellite altimeters used in the remote sensing of ocean surface height,  wave height and wind speed are Seasat, Geosat and Topex/Poseidon.

The TMR measures the sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18 GHz, 21 GHz and 37 GHz) to provide the total water-vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 21 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement.
It is redundant (21A and 21B).
The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover, respectively in the water-vapor measurement.
TMR data are sent to CNES for processing along with their altimeter data.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains the crossover points from  TOPEX(ocean TOPography EXperiment)/Poseidon Merged Geophysical Data Record version B (MGDR-B).
The MGDR-B combines measurements from two altimeters, TOPEX, a NASA dual frequency (Ku and C band) instrument, and a French (CNES) instrument which is a proof-of-concept solid-state altimeter, Poseidon (Ku band).
The parameters are slightly different than the regular pass data in the MGDR-B, but does contain significant wave height, sigma-0, wet troposphere, ionospheric correction, tides and the parameters required to calculate Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA).
For more information on the parameters please visit ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/topex/L2/mgdrb/docs/uhmgdrb/html/uhsec08.htm.
