SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT mission is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997.
The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains polar-stereographic-gridded Sigma-0 retrieval statistics over the Arctic Polar region from the QuikSCAT L1B retrievals, which are generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU); the processed files are therefore known as SIR files.
The QuikSCAT scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively.
The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized.
The SIR files are all contained within a single tar file for a given day.
When the tar file is unpacked, the individual SIR files are separated according to polarization and the corresponding retrieval statistic (i.e., daily average, standard deviation, and daily measurement counts).
Consequently, there are 6 SIR files contained within each unpacked tar file.
These SIR files were also used to generate a complimentary dataset of GIF images representing the daily averaged Sigma-0, which is meant for browse purposes only and available here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_IMAGES.
An additional complimentary dataset includes a reduced version of these Sigma-0 retrieval statistics by providing only the daily Sigma-0 average: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_LITE.
This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.
