The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument provides high radiometric sensitivity (12 bit) in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 m to 14.4 m. It is used for observing processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.
The Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI)  has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels.
Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle.

Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Datasets
Aqua is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
MetOp-A is the first in a series of three polar-orbiting European meteorological satellites,  launched on 19 October 2006 as part of the EUMETSAT Polar System.
Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) provides multi-spectral imagery of the Earth's surface and cloud systems from a geostationary orbit.
Terra is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including aerosols, clouds, radiation balance, land cover, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
NOAA (national oceanic and atmospheric administration) satellite number 19 Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership is a joint mission between NASA, DOD and NOAA.
GCOM represents a series of JAXA Earth Observation Missions and GCOM-W1 carries instrumentation to measure the water cycle

NEAR_REAL_TIME
A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on an operational basis by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) using an optimal interpolation (OI) approach on a global 0.05 degree grid.
The analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several satellites.
The sensors include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua.
An ice field from the EUMETSAT OSI-SAF is used to mask out areas with ice.
This dataset adheres to the version 2 GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS).
