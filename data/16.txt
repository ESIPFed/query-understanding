The Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI)  has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels.
Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle.

Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) provides multi-spectral imagery of the Earth's surface and cloud systems from a geostationary orbit.

NEAR_REAL_TIME
The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites  are spin stabilized geostationary satellites operated by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) to provide accurate weather monitoring data through its primary instrument the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), which has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels.
Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle.
This Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset produced by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is derived from the SEVIRI instrument on the second MSG satellite (also known as  Meteosat-9) that was launched on 22 December 2005.
Skin sea surface temperature (SST) data are calculated from the infrared channels of SEVIRI at full resolution every 15 minutes.
L2P data products with Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5.
