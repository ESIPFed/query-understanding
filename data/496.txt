Aquarius/SAC-D mission datasets
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships at various depths.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.

Aquarius Level 3 ancillary sea surface temperature (SST) standard mapped image data are the ancillary SST data used in the Aquarius calibration for salinity retrieval.
They are simply the daily SSTs from the Reynolds National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) 0.25 degree GHRSST dataset, gridded and averaged using the Aquarius processing L2-L3 processing scheme to the same 1 degree spatial resolution and daily, 7 day, monthly, seasonal, and annual time intervals as Aquarius L3 standard salinity and wind speed products.
This particular data set is the mission series mean or cumulative, descending ancillary sea surface temperature product associated with version 4.0  of the Aquarius data set, which is the official end of prime mission public data release from the AQUARIUS/SAC-D mission.
