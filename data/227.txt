Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research   Environments
The accelerometer, located at the center of mass of each satellite, measures all non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite.
These forces include air drag, solar radiation pressure, and attitude control activator operation.
The two star cameras mounted close to the accelerometer on each satellite provide
the precise attitude references for the satellites when making science
measurements.
This instrument precisely measures the changes in the separation between the two GRACE satellites using phase tracking of K- and Ka-band signals sent between the two satellites

The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a joint US/German satellite mission that will accurately map variations in the Earth's gravity field over its 5-year lifetime.
The twin GRACE satellites were launched March 17, 2002.
GRACE is a joint partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States and Deutsches Zentrum fu?
?r Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany.
Dr. Byron Tapley of The University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) is the Principal Investigator (PI), and Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam is the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI).
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory carries out project management and systems engineering activities.

The animation was generated from monthly land mass grids containing terrestrial water masses (aquifers, river basins, etc.)
given as equivalent water thickness derived from GRACE JPL gravity data, in GIF format.
Equivalent water thickness is used to represent changes in water mass as height changes since the area of a grid pixel remains only the height can change as the amount of water changes.
The time coverage for the monthly grids are determined by GRACE months.
For the list of GRACE month dates visit http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/grace-months/.
