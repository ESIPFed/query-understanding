Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2
The Poseidon-3 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the OSTM mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionoshperic correction.
The Poseidon-3 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.

OSTM, the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-2 follow-on, is an oceanographic mission to study global ocean circulation, improve climate predictions and monitor events such as El Nino conditions.
It is a joint mission between CNES, NASA, NOAA and EUMETSAT.

NEAR_REAL_TIME
This dataset is similar to the OSTM/Jason-2 Operation Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) that is distributed at NOAA (ftp://data.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/jason2/ogdr/), but also includes a GPS based orbit and Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) calculated from that orbit, as supposed to the DORIS based orbit that is already available in the OGDR.
It has a 5 hour time lag due to the time needed to recalculate the orbit and SSHA.
The GPS orbits have been shown to be more accurate than the DORIS orbits on a near real time scale and therefore produces a more accurate SSHA.
