The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) is a twelve-channel, six-frequency, total power passive-microwave radiometer system.
The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument provides high radiometric sensitivity (12 bit) in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelength from 0.4 m to 14.4 m. It is used for observing processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.

Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Datasets
Aqua is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
Aqua is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.
Terra is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including aerosols, clouds, radiation balance, land cover, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.

HISTORICAL
A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced as a retrospective dataset at the JPL Physical Oceanography DAAC using wavelets as basis functions in an optimal interpolation approach on a regional 0.011 degree grid over the oceans off North and Central America (62N- 20S, 165W - 30W).
The Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments such as: the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms.
The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center.
This data set is funded by the NASA MEaSUREs program (http://earthdata.nasa.gov/our-community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects), and created by a team led by Dr. Toshio Chin from JPL.
