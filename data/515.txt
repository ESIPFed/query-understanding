Every two days, under all weather and cloud conditions, NSCAT measured wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the Earth's ice-free oceans.
NSCAT used six antenna beams to scan two wide bands of ocean, one on each side of the instrument's orbital path.
NSCAT transmited short pulses of microwave energy to probe ocean surfaces and then measured the reflected or backscattered power.
Variations in the magnitude of this backscattered power are caused by changes in small (centimeter-sized), wind-driven waves.
Using a method called Doppler processing, the measured backscattered power was separated into cells at specific locations on Earth's surface.

NSCAT
The ADvanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) launched in August 1996, was a joint international cooperative program to contribute to global environmental monitoring.
ADEOS had the following instrumentation onboard: advanced visible near infrared radiometer; ocean color and temperature scanner; NASA Scatterometer; total ozone mapping spectrometer; polarization and directionality of the earth's reflectance; interferometric monitor for greenhouse gases; improved limb atmospheric spectrometer; and retroreflector in space.

HISTORICAL
The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Level 3 Mean Wind Fields dataset is produced and distributed by IFREMER/CERSAT.
Weekly and monthly mean ocean surface wind vectors, wind stress, wind divergence, and stress curl fields are provided on a global 1x1 degree grid.
Standard errors of each parameter are also computed and provided as complimentary gridded fields.
An objective statistical interpolation is performed  to reconstruct gap-filled and averaged synoptic fields from discrete observations over each time period.
This dataset is part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) package.
