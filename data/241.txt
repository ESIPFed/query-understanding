Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer.
This radiometer has the capability to provide detailed maps of thermal radiation from the sea surface, and clouds.
The AVHRR operates in two modes: 1) High Resolution Picture Image or HRPT mode, which are high density images with 1km resolution, and are transmitted directly to local ground stations and 2) Global Area Coverage, or GAC mode, which are the same observations as are transmitted during the HRPT mode, but averaged together to obtain a value representative of an area 4km in diameter.
GAC data are digitized and recorded on the satellite to provide global coverage.

Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Datasets
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships at various depths.
MetOp-A is the first in a series of three polar-orbiting European meteorological satellites,  launched on 19 October 2006 as part of the EUMETSAT Polar System.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.
NOAA (national oceanic and atmospheric administration) satellite number 19 Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership is a joint mission between NASA, DOD and NOAA.
MetOp-A is the second in a series of three polar-orbiting European meteorological satellites,  launched on 17 September 2012 as part of the EUMETSAT Polar System.
GCOM represents a series of JAXA Earth Observation Missions and GCOM-W1 carries instrumentation to measure the water cycle

NEAR_REAL_TIME
A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature (SST) analysis produced daily on an operational basis at the Canadian Meteorological Center.
This dataset merges infrared satellite SST at varying points in the time series from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from NOAA-18,19, the European Meteorological Operational-A (METOP-A) and Operational-B (METOP-B), and microwave data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W satellite in conjunction with in situ observations of SST from drifting buoys and ships from the ICOADS program.
It uses the previous days analysis as the background field for the statistical interpolation used to assimilate the satellite and in situ observations.
This dataset adheres to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications.
