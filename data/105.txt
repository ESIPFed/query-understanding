Scatterometry Climate Record Pathfinder
Every two days, under all weather and cloud conditions, NSCAT measured wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the Earth's ice-free oceans.
NSCAT used six antenna beams to scan two wide bands of ocean, one on each side of the instrument's orbital path.
NSCAT transmited short pulses of microwave energy to probe ocean surfaces and then measured the reflected or backscattered power.
Variations in the magnitude of this backscattered power are caused by changes in small (centimeter-sized), wind-driven waves.
Using a method called Doppler processing, the measured backscattered power was separated into cells at specific locations on Earth's surface.

Enhanced Resolution Sigma-0 Datasets from BYU/SCP
The ADvanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) launched in August 1996, was a joint international cooperative program to contribute to global environmental monitoring.
ADEOS had the following instrumentation onboard: advanced visible near infrared radiometer; ocean color and temperature scanner; NASA Scatterometer; total ozone mapping spectrometer; polarization and directionality of the earth's reflectance; interferometric monitor for greenhouse gases; improved limb atmospheric spectrometer; and retroreflector in space.

HISTORICAL
This NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) satellite Sigma-0 dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at Brigham Young University (BYU) and is generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long.
The SIR technique results in an enhanced resolution image reconstruction and gridded on an equal-area grid (for non-polar regions) at 4.45 km pixel resolution stored in SIR files; polar regions are gridded using a polar-stereographic technique.
A non-enhanced version is provided at 22.25 km pixel resolution in a format known as GRD files.
All files are produced in IEEE formatted binary.
All data files are separated and organized by region, polarization, parameter, and sampling technique (i.e., SIR vs. GRD).
The regions of China and Japan are combined into a single region.
In additional to Sigma-0, various statistical parameters are provided for added guidance, including but not limited to: standard deviation, measurement counts, pixel time, Sigma-0 error, and average incidence angle.
