SeaWinds on ADEOS-II
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

The second Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II) was as a NASDA/NASA/JPL partner mission launched on December 14, 2002.
By April 10, 2003 the SeaWinds scattorometer on ADEOS-II began to provide science quality measurements to derive ocean surface wind velocity observations.
ADEOS-II suffered a premature power failure on October 24, 2003, which resulted in the termination of the ADEOS-II mission.
SeaWinds on ADEOS-II provided the same 90aily global ice-free ocean coverage as QuikSCAT, allowing for a tandem collection of high quality wind vector observations for more than 6 months.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains Level 2B science-quality ocean surface wind vector retrievals from the SeaWinds on ADEOS-II scatterometer.
The retrievals are provided on a non-uniform grid within the swath at 12.5 km pixel resolution.
Higher resolution is achieved through a slice composite technique in which high resolution slice measurements from L1B data are composited into a 12.5 km wind vector cell.
The increased sampling resolution enables users to obtain wind vectors 10 km closer to shore when compared to the 25 km L2B dataset.
Each L2B file corresponds to a specific orbital revolution (rev) number, which begins at the southernmost point of the ascending orbit.
The granule metadata is consistent with the QuikSCAT L2B dataset, with exception of the amsr_rain_indicator provided by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instrument aboard the ADEOS-II spacecraft.
Also, the wvc_quality_flag utilizes bits 2-6 for AMSR-related data quality assessment; these bits are left empty in the QuikSCAT L2B wvc_quality_flag variable.
An ASCII inline quality report (Q2B) has been generated for each L2B file; each Q2B file provides statistics of various quality elements pertaining to the processing of a specific L2B file.
This is the official dataset produced by the QuikSCAT Project through the SeaWinds Processing and Analysis Center (SeaPAC).
