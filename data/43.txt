Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment
The accelerometer, located at the center of mass of each satellite, measures all non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite.
These forces include air drag, solar radiation pressure, and attitude control activator operation.
The two star cameras mounted close to the accelerometer on each satellite provide
the precise attitude references for the satellites when making science
measurements.
This instrument precisely measures the changes in the separation between the two GRACE satellites using phase tracking of K- and Ka-band signals sent between the two satellites

The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a joint US/German satellite mission that will accurately map variations in the Earth's gravity field over its 5-year lifetime.
The twin GRACE satellites were launched March 17, 2002.
GRACE is a joint partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States and Deutsches Zentrum fu?
?r Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany.
Dr. Byron Tapley of The University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) is the Principal Investigator (PI), and Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam is the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI).
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory carries out project management and systems engineering activities.
