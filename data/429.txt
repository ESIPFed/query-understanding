Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research   Environments
The accelerometer, located at the center of mass of each satellite, measures all non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite.
These forces include air drag, solar radiation pressure, and attitude control activator operation.
The two star cameras mounted close to the accelerometer on each satellite provide
the precise attitude references for the satellites when making science
measurements.
This instrument precisely measures the changes in the separation between the two GRACE satellites using phase tracking of K- and Ka-band signals sent between the two satellites

The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a joint US/German satellite mission that will accurately map variations in the Earth's gravity field over its 5-year lifetime.
The twin GRACE satellites were launched March 17, 2002.
GRACE is a joint partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States and Deutsches Zentrum fu?
?r Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany.
Dr. Byron Tapley of The University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) is the Principal Investigator (PI), and Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam is the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI).
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory carries out project management and systems engineering activities.

DELAY_MODE
This dataset contains the spherical harmonic coefficients C(1,0), C(1,1), S(1,1) vs time.
An estimate of the degree 1 gravity coefficients were determined based on ocean and atmospheric models and GRACE coefficients for degrees 2 and higher (Swenson et al.
2008).
The coefficients in this dataset represent the land component of the degree 1 gravity coefficients, normalized using the GRACE standards.
For land applications use, apply these coefficients with the GRACE GSM coefficients for degrees 2 and higher and with a degree 1 Love number (k1) = 0.021.
For ocean applications, add the degree 1 values found in the ocean bottom pressure dataset (GAD) to the degree 1 coefficients.
If you are interested in adding the full ocean, land and atmosphere coefficients, add the degree 1 values of the atmosphere/ocean dataset (GAC) to these values.
Data format is smiler to that for GSM, GAD and GAC files distributed by PO.DAAC, where the fist column is the month in yearmonth.
