The GOES I-M Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense radiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the Earth.
The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a two-axis mirror scan system.
The instrument can produce full-Earth disc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and various sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene using a new flexible scan system.
Scan selection permits rapid continuous viewing of local areas for monitoring of mesoscale (regional) phenomena and accurate wind determination.

The GOES system maintains a continuous data stream from a two-GOES system in support of the National Weather Service requirements.
These satellites send weather data and pictures that cover various sections of the United States.

NEAR_REAL_TIME
Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) are derived from the series of Geostationary Environmental Satellites using GOES Imagers with five-band multispectral capability,10 bit precision and high spatial resolution.The GOES 6km Near Real-Time data set consists of Level 3 SSTs derived from GOES East and GOES West with a spatial resolution of approximately 6km.
Data sets are available in one hour, three hour, and 24 hour gridded sea surface temperatures.
The grid covers much of the Western Hemisphere bounded by 180W, 30W, 60N and 45S.
