The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) is a twelve-channel, six-frequency, total power passive-microwave radiometer system.
The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) is a passive microwave sensor designed to provide quantitative rainfall information over a wide swath under the TRMM satellite.
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

WindSat is a microwave polarimetric radiometer designed with the capability of retrieving ocean surface wind vectors using three fully polarimetric feed horns at 10.7, 18.7, and 37.0 GHz.
With 2 additional dual-polarized (i.e., not fully polarimetric) radiometer bands and a total of 22 descrete micrwave channels, WindSat can also retrieve sea surface temperature, rain rate, water vaper, and cloud liquid water.
The Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder, flown on board the DMSP F16 and F17 platforms, is designed to measure ocean surface wind speed, ice coverage and age, cloud water content, rainfall and atmospheric vertical temperature and humidity profiles.

Aqua is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) designed to monitor and study tropical rainfall.
The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT mission is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997.
The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans.
The second Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II) was as a NASDA/NASA/JPL partner mission launched on December 14, 2002.
By April 10, 2003 the SeaWinds scattorometer on ADEOS-II began to provide science quality measurements to derive ocean surface wind velocity observations.
ADEOS-II suffered a premature power failure on October 24, 2003, which resulted in the termination of the ADEOS-II mission.
SeaWinds on ADEOS-II provided the same 90aily global ice-free ocean coverage as QuikSCAT, allowing for a tandem collection of high quality wind vector observations for more than 6 months.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F08, is an Air Force Meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides space-borned measurements of wind speed, atmospheric liquid water and integrated water vapor over the oceans.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F10, is an Air Force Meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides space-borned measurements of wind speed, atmospheric liquid water and integrated water vapor over the oceans.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F13, is an Air Force Meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides space-borned measurements of wind speed, atmospheric liquid water and integrated water vapor over the oceans.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F11, is an Air Force Meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides space-borned measurements of wind speed, atmospheric liquid water and integrated water vapor over the oceans.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F14, is an Air Force Meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides space-borned measurements of wind speed, atmospheric liquid water and integrated water vapor over the oceans.
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F15 is an Air Force meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which provides space-borne retrievals of ocean surface wind speed, among other ocean/atmosphere parameters.
The Coriolis satellite platform is a joint operation between the U.S. Navy and the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Integrated Program Office (IPO).
Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-F17 is an Air Force Meteorological satellite which bears an instrument called the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), which provides space-borned measurements of wind speed, atmospheric liquid water and integrated water vapor over the oceans.

This dataset is derived under the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) project and contains a value-added 5-day mean ocean surface wind and pseudostress to approximate a satellite-only climatological data record.
The CCMP datasets combine cross-calibrated satellite winds obtained from Remote Sensing Systems (REMSS) using a Variational Analysis Method (VAM) to produce a high-resolution (0.25 degree) gridded analysis.
The CCMP data set includes cross-calibrated satellite winds derived from SSM/I, SSMIS, AMSR-E, TRMM TMI, QuikSCAT, SeaWinds, WindSat and other satellite instruments as they become available from REMSS.
REMSS uses a cross-calibrated sea-surface emissivity model function which improves the consistency between wind speed retrievals from microwave radiometers (i.e., SSM/I, SSMIS AMSR, TMI, and WindSat) and those from scatterometers (i.e., QuikSCAT and SeaWinds).
The VAM combines these data with in situ measurements and a starting estimate (first guess) of the wind field.
The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 Reanalysis is used as the first-guess from 1987 to 1998.
The ECMWF Operational analysis is used from January 1999 onward.
All wind observations and analysis fields are referenced to a height of 10 meters.
The ERA-40 can be obtained from the Computation and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds117.0/.
The ECMWF Operational analysis can also be obtained from CISL at NCAR: http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds111.1/.
Three products are distributed to complete the CCMP dataset series.
L3.0 product contains high-resolution analyses every 6-hours.
These data are then time averaged over monthly and 5-day periods to derive the L3.5 product.
Directions from the L3.0 product are then assigned to the time and location of the passive microwave satellite wind speed observations to derive the L2.5 product.
All datasets are distributed on a 0.25 degree cylindrical coordinate grid.
This dataset is one in a series of First-Look (FLK) CCMP datasets and is a continuation and expansion of the SSM/I surface wind velocity project that began under the NASA Pathfinder Program.
Refinements and upgrades to the FLK version will be incorporated under a new release (date to be determined) known as Late-look (LLK) and may include additional satellite datasets.
All satellite surface wind data are obtained from REMSS under the DISCOVER project: Distributed Information Services: Climate/Ocean Products and Visualizations for Earth Research (http://www.discover-earth.org/index.html).
The CCMP project is the result of an investigation funded by the NASA Making Earth Science data records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program (http://community.eosdis.nasa.gov/measures/).
In accordance with the MEaSUREs program, the CCMP datasets are also known as Earth System Data Records (ESDRs).
In collaboration with private and government institutions, a team led by Dr. Robert Atlas (PI; proposal originally solicited by REASoN, and currently funded by MEaSURES) has created the CCMP project to provide multi-instrument ocean surface wind velocity ESDRs, with wide ranging research applications in meteorology and oceanography.
