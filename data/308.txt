Scatterometry Climate Record Pathfinder
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT mission is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997.
The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains GIF images of polar-stereographic-gridded Sigma-0 retrievals over the Antarctic Polar region from SeaWinds on QuikSCAT retrievals subsetted and averaged twice daily at the local time-of-day (LTOD); local times are approximately morning (00:00 to 08:00 local) and evening (16:00 to 24:00 local).
The eight hour interval at each LTOD reference of morning vs. evening corresponds to the natural boundaries of time separation within the data at polar latitudes.
Hence, morning and evening are used as approximations for the LTOD reference, where the actual LTOD may vary within the respective 8 hour interval.
It should be noted that these GIF images are meant for browse purposes only and should not be considered science quality.
The GIF images are generated from a scientific dataset employing a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU); the science quality source dataset containing the SIR files used to generate the GIF images is accessible here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/QSCAT_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_MAPS_LTOD.
The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively.
The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized.
As with the SIR files, the GIF images are separated according to polarization.
For example, one SIR file for a particular day and LTOD will contain the gridded average Sigma-0 values derived from the horizontally polarized L1B retrievals, while the other will contain those from the vertically polarized L1B retrievals.
This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.
