The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.

The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.

The NOAA/NCEP Reynolds Optimally Interpolated (OI) Sea Surface Temperature monthly Level 4 product consists of aggregate global sea surface temperature fields on a 1 degree by 1 degree grid over a month time interval.
The OI analysis employed uses both in-situ SSTs from ships and buoys and satellite derived SSTs from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).
The satellite derived SSTs are from the Multichannel Sea Surface Temperature products that have been constructed operationally from the five-channel AVHRR by NOAA's Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) since late 1981 through to present.
Monthly OI SST fields are derived by a linear interpolation of the weekly optimum interpolation (OI) fields to daily fields then averaging the daily values over a month.
The monthly fields are in the same format and spatial resolution as the weekly fields, which have been widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting.
Version 2.0 of this dataset utilizes an update and extension of the COADS in-situ data series providing enhanced ship data coverage through 1997 and reducing the residual satellite biases in otherwise data sparse regions.
This version also implements enhancements to the OI analysis utilizing simulations of SST observations from an improved sea ice algorithm and data following a technique developed at the UK Met Office, improvements that further reduce biases in the OI SST particularly at higher latitudes.
