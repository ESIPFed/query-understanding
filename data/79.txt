Rapid Scatterometer
The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-purpose habitable spacecraft in low-earth orbit.
The ISS-RapidScat instrument is a speedy and cost-effective replacement for NASA's QuikScat Earth satellite, which monitored ocean winds to provide essential measurements used in weather predictions, including hurricane monitoring.

This dataset contains the RapidScat Level 2B 12.5km Version 1.0 Climate quality ocean surface wind vectors.
The Level 2B wind vectors are binned on a 12.5 km Wind Vector Cell (WVC) grid and processed using the using the "full aperture" normalized radar cross-section (NRCS, a.k.a.
Sigma-0) from the L1B dataset.
RapidScat is a Ku-band dual beam circular rotating scatterometer retaining much of the same hardware and functionality of QuikSCAT, with exception of the antenna sub-system and digital interface to the International Space Station (ISS) Columbus module, which is where RapidScat is mounted.
The NASA mission is officially referred to as ISS-RapidScat.
Unlike QuikSCAT, ISS-RapidScat is not in sun-synchronous orbit, and flies at roughly half the altitude with a low inclination angle that restricts data coverage to the tropics and mid-latitude regions; the extent of latitudinal coverage stretches from approximately 56 degrees North to 56 degrees South.
Furthermore, there is no consistent local time of day retrieval.
This dataset is provided in a netCDF-3 file format that follows the netCDF-4 classic model (i.e., generated by the netCDF-4 API) and made available via FTP and OPeNDAP.
For data access, please click on the "Data Access" tab above.
This climate quality data set differs from the nominal "slice" L2B dataset as follows: 1) it uses full antenna footprint measurements (~20-km) without subdividing by range (~7-km) and 2) the absolute calibration has been modified for the two different low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mode data sets: LowSNR1 14 August 2015 to 18 September 2015; LowSNR2 6 October 2015 to 7 February 2016.
The above enhancements allow this dataset to provide consistent calibration across all SNR states.
As a result of the infrequent and unpredictable transition between high and low SNR states, this dataset will only be updated when new low SNR state transitions occur.
The delay in updating new data to this dataset time series allows the calibration to be better controlled over longer time periods, thus resulting in a final data product that is more suitable for climate research.
Low SNR periods and other key quality control (QC) issues are tracked and kept up-to-date here: ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/rapidscat/ancillary/revtime.csv.
