In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.
The Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI)  has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels.
Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle.
The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) is a passive microwave sensor designed to provide quantitative rainfall information over a wide swath under the TRMM satellite.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.
he GOES Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense radiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the Earth.
The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep east-west a

Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Datasets
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships at various depths.
MetOp-A is the first in a series of three polar-orbiting European meteorological satellites,  launched on 19 October 2006 as part of the EUMETSAT Polar System.
Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) provides multi-spectral imagery of the Earth's surface and cloud systems from a geostationary orbit.
The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) designed to monitor and study tropical rainfall.

A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on an operational basis at the UK Met Office using optimal interpolation (OI) on a global 0.054 degree grid.
The Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) analysis uses satellite data from sensors that include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager, the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) and in situ data from ships, drifting and moored buoys.
This analysis was specifically produced to be used as a lower boundary condition in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models.
This dataset adheres to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications.
