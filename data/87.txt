The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) is a twelve-channel, six-frequency, total power passive-microwave radiometer system.
Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) is one of the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) instruments on board the European Space Agency (ESA) satellite ENVISAT.
It is the most recent in a series of instruments designed primarily to measure Sea Surface Temperature (SST), following on from ATSR-1 and ATSR-2 on board ERS-1 and ERS-2.
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.

WindSat is a microwave polarimetric radiometer designed with the capability of retrieving ocean surface wind vectors using three fully polarimetric feed horns at 10.7, 18.7, and 37.0 GHz.
With 2 additional dual-polarized (i.e., not fully polarimetric) radiometer bands and a total of 22 descrete micrwave channels, WindSat can also retrieve sea surface temperature, rain rate, water vaper, and cloud liquid water.

Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Datasets
Aqua is a NASA polar orbiting mission designed to collect information on the Earth's atmospheric, land and ocean systems, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, ice, and ocean sea surface temperature and color.
Envisat, is an advanced polar-orbiting Earth observation satellite which provides measurements of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice.
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships at various depths.
MetOp-A is the first in a series of three polar-orbiting European meteorological satellites,  launched on 19 October 2006 as part of the EUMETSAT Polar System.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.

The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) designed to monitor and study tropical rainfall.
As the most comprehensive modern day source of satellite environmental data, the ERS spacecraft have brought significant benefits to Europe and the rest of the world.These benefits have ranged from improved public services, such as weather forecasting and crop monitoring, to the creation and sharing of commercial and industrial enterprises, and helping European scientists to excel in key areas of environmental research.

NEAR_REAL_TIME
A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature (SST) analysis produced daily on an operational basis at the Canadian Meteorological Center.
This dataset merges infrared satellite SST at varying points in the time series from the (A)TSR series of radiometers from ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat, AVHRR from NOAA-16,17,18,19 and METOP-A, and microwave data from TMI, AMSR-E and Windsat in conjunction with in situ observations of SST from drifting buoys and ships from the ICOADS program.
It uses the previous days analysis as the background field for the statistical interpolation used to assimilate the satellite and in situ observations.
This dataset adheres to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications.
