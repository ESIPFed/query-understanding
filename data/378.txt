Earth Observing System Data Information System
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT mission is a "quick recovery" mission to fill the gap created by the loss of data from the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT), when the satellite it was flying on lost power in June 1997.
The SeaWinds instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind speed and direction under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans.

HISTORICAL
The SeaWinds on QuikSCAT Level 2A Surface-flagged Sigma-0 in 25km Wind Vector Cells are processed using the pulse Sigma-0 data provided by the Level 1B product.
Unlike NSCAT, the expected number of Sigma-0 cells per WVC is not constant, due to the circular scan of the SeaWinds instrument.
To minimize the L2A data volume, the Sigma-0 cell data are stored as "lists" for each WVC row, with each list indexed by a "cell_index" array to indicate the cross-track WVC membership of the data.
Each cell is then checked for land or ice and flagged accordingly.
Attenuation corrections for each Sigma-0 measurement are also provided.
Quality Assurance files are also included to verify the quality of the L2A processing.
Data are provided in single-orbit files.
Special note: QuikSCAT went into a "non-spinning" mode on 22 November 2009.
The final rev number in the nominal Operational "spinning" mode is 54296; the "non-spinning" mode of the instrument continued predominantly for the remainder of QuikSCAT operations.
There were some brief periods of "spinning" in year 2013, which include the following days and rev numbers (identified in parenthesis): 1) 29 January to 5 February (7909-71011), 2) 14 March (71536-71549), 3) 18 March to 21 March (71590-71634), and 4) 28 March to 31 March (71735-71769).
