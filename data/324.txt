AQUARIUS SAC-D
Launched in 2011 the 3 Aquarius radiometers meet very exacting requirements for low noise and calibration stability.
This makes them about an order of magnitude more accurate than any radiometer ever used before for remote sensing of the earth.
Aquarius measures in the microwave range at 1.413 GHz (+/- 25MHz).
The Aquarius  scatterometer  is a total-power L-band (1.26 GHz)
radar system for estimating ocean surface roughness.
Its
measurements will enable the removal of wind effects from the
Aquarius radiometer ocean-surface brightness temperature
measurements being used to retrieve ocean salinity.
The
Aquarius scatterometer is a relatively simple, low-spatial
resolution power-detecting radar, without ranging capability.
But to meet its science requirement, it must be very stable, with
repeatability on the order of 0.1 dB over several days, and
calibrated accuracy to this level over several months.
Data
from this instrument over land as well as ocean areas will be
available for a variety of geophysical applications.

Aquarius SAC-D is a joint venture between NASA and Argentina's Space Agency CONAE.
In addition to NASA's  Aquarius instrument CONAE instruments include MWR (Microwave Radiometer), NIRST (New Infrared Sensor Technology), HSC (High Sensitivity Camera),  TDP (Technological Demonstration Package) and DCS (Data Collection System).
Italy's ASI is providing ROSA (Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmosphere) and France's CNES Carmen 1 which consists of ICARE (Cosmic radiation effects) and SODAD (micro particles and space debris).

Version 4.0 Aquarius CAP Level 3 products are the third release of the AQUARIUS/SAC-D mapped salinity and wind speed data based on the Combined Active Passive (CAP) algorithm.
CAP Level 3 standard mapped image products contain gridded 1 degree spatial resolution salinity and wind speed data averaged over 7 day and monthly time scales.
This particular data set is the monthly sea surface salinity (SSS) V4.0 Aquarius CAP product.
CAP is a P.I.
produced data set developed and provided by the JPL Climate Oceans and Solid Earth group (S. Yueh).
The CAP algorithm utilizes data from both the onboard radiometer and scatterometer to simultaneously retrieve salinity, wind speed and direction by minimizing the sum of squared differences between model and observations.
The main improvement in CAP V4.0 is calibration of the rain roughness correction geophysical model function to  HYCOM SSS adjusted by the Rain Impact Model (RIM) to account for the rain induced near surface stratification.
Rain corrected salinity retrieval at L2 is based on collocation with ancillary rain rate from NOAA CMORPH at 0.25 degree and 30 minute resolution, replacing the SSMI/S and WindSAT data previously used previously for this in CAP V3.0.
The Aquarius instrument is onboard the AQUARIUS/SAC-D satellite, a collaborative effort between NASA and the Argentinian Space Agency Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE).
The instrument consists of three radiometers in push broom alignment at incidence angles of 29, 38, and 46 degrees incidence angles relative to the shadow side of the orbit.
Footprints for the beams are: 76 km (along-track) x 94 km (cross-track), 84 km x 120 km and 96km x 156 km, yielding a total cross-track swath of 370 km.
The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.413 GHz in their respective horizontal and vertical polarizations (TH and TV).
A scatterometer operating at 1.26 GHz measures ocean backscatter in each footprint that is used for surface roughness corrections in the estimation of salinity.
The scatterometer has an approximate 390km swath.
