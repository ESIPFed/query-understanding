The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.

Climate Data Record
In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships at various depths.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.

NEAR_REAL_TIME
A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) global Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on a 0.25 degree grid at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center.
This product uses optimal interpolation (OI) using data from the 4 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Version 5 time series (when available, otherwise operational NOAA AVHRR data are used) and in situ ship and buoy observations.
A second similar product is available that also includes Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) data from June 2002 onward.
The OI analysis is a daily average SST that is bias adjusted using a spatially smoothed 7-day in situ SST average and is thus tuned to about 0.3 meter.
Both day and night satellite fields are independently bias adjusted.
