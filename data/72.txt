TOPEX/Poseidon
A satellite altimeter consists of a transmitter that sends out very sharp pulses, a sensitive receiver to record the pulse after it is reflected from the sea surface, and an accurate clock to note the time interval between transmission and reception.
Examples of satellite altimeters used in the remote sensing of ocean surface height,  wave height and wind speed are Seasat, Geosat and Topex/Poseidon.

The TMR measures the sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18 GHz, 21 GHz and 37 GHz) to provide the total water-vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 21 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement.
It is redundant (21A and 21B).
The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover, respectively in the water-vapor measurement.
TMR data are sent to CNES for processing along with their altimeter data.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.

HISTORICAL
The TOPEX/POSEIDON MGDR (Merged Geophysical Data Record) contains global coverage altimeter data.
This data set (MGDR-B) contains generation B data which replaces the generation A data set.
The objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission, launched in August 1992 and currently operating, is to determine ocean topography with a sea surface height measurement precision of 3 cm and a sea level measurement accuracy of 13 cm.
The data product combines measurements from two altimeters, a NASA dual frequency (Ku and C band) instrument similar to the Geosat altimeter, and a French (CNES) instrument which is a proof-of-concept solid-state altimeter (Ku band).
This data set contains mean sea surface, ionospheric corrections, sigma0 and all parameters needed to calculate sea surface height anomalies and total electron content.
The data are in binary format.
