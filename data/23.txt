The Poseidon-2 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the JASON-1 mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionospheric correction.
The Poseidon-2 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.
The JMR mreasures teh sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz and 34.0 GHz) to provide the total water vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement and is a redundant channel on the JMR.
The 18.7 GHz channel provides a correction for wind-induced effects in the sea surface background emissions, and the 34.0 GHz channel provides a correction for cloud liquid water.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.
The DORIS system uses a two-channels receiver (1401.25 MHz and 2036.25 MHz) on the satellite to observe the Doppler signals from a network of 40 to 50 ground transmitting stations.
It provides all-weather global tracking of the satellite for CNES precise orbit determination and an accurate correction for the influence of the ionosphere on both the Doppler signal and altimeter signals.

Jason-1, the TOPEX/POSEIDON follow-on, is an oceanography mission to study global ocean circulation, improve climate predictions, and monitor events such as El Nino conditions.
It is a joint mission between CNES, the French space agency, and NASA, the U.S. space agency.

HISTORICAL
The Jason-1 Geophysical Data Records (GDR) contain full accuracy altimeter data, with a high precision orbit (accuracy ~2.5 cm), provided approximately 35 days after data collection.
The instruments on Jason-1 make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed), ionospheric electron content (derived by a simple formula), tropospheric water content, mean sea surface, and position relative to the GPS satellite constellation.
The GDR contain all relevant corrections needed to calculate the sea surface height.
Sea surface height anomalies calculation and recommended data edit criteria arespecified in the Jason-1 I/GDR User Handbook located at ftp://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/allData/jason1/L2/gdr_c/docs/Handbook_Jason_v4-1.pdf.
This is not the official format from the project and therefore is not validated.
