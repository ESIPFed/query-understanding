Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research   Environments
The accelerometer, located at the center of mass of each satellite, measures all non-gravitational forces acting on each satellite.
These forces include air drag, solar radiation pressure, and attitude control activator operation.
The two star cameras mounted close to the accelerometer on each satellite provide
the precise attitude references for the satellites when making science
measurements.
This instrument precisely measures the changes in the separation between the two GRACE satellites using phase tracking of K- and Ka-band signals sent between the two satellites

The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a joint US/German satellite mission that will accurately map variations in the Earth's gravity field over its 5-year lifetime.
The twin GRACE satellites were launched March 17, 2002.
GRACE is a joint partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States and Deutsches Zentrum fu?
?r Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany.
Dr. Byron Tapley of The University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) is the Principal Investigator (PI), and Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam is the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI).
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory carries out project management and systems engineering activities.

The twin satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), launched in March of 2002, are making detailed monthly measurements of Earth's gravity field changes.
These observations can detect regional mass changes of Earth's water reservoirs over land, ice and oceans.
GRACE measures gravity variations by relating it to the distance variations between the two satellites, which fly in the same orbit, separated by about 240 km at an altitude of ~450 km.
The monthly ocean mass grids contain ocean bottom pressure anomalies from GRACE time-variable gravity data processed by GFZ relative to a time-mean.
The bottom pressure anomalies are given in 'equivalent water thickness'  (in NetCDF format), so can be compared to sea level anomalies due to changes of water mass (reference density is 1027 kg/m^3).
The time coverage for the monthly grids are determined by GRACE months.
For the list of GRACE month dates visit 
http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/grace-months/.
For more information please visit http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/monthly-mass-grids-ocean/.
Contains a timetable of data availability from GRACE for each month starting from the beginning of the GRACE mission.
