Every two days, under all weather and cloud conditions, NSCAT measured wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the Earth's ice-free oceans.
NSCAT used six antenna beams to scan two wide bands of ocean, one on each side of the instrument's orbital path.
NSCAT transmited short pulses of microwave energy to probe ocean surfaces and then measured the reflected or backscattered power.
Variations in the magnitude of this backscattered power are caused by changes in small (centimeter-sized), wind-driven waves.
Using a method called Doppler processing, the measured backscattered power was separated into cells at specific locations on Earth's surface.

The ADvanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) launched in August 1996, was a joint international cooperative program to contribute to global environmental monitoring.
ADEOS had the following instrumentation onboard: advanced visible near infrared radiometer; ocean color and temperature scanner; NASA Scatterometer; total ozone mapping spectrometer; polarization and directionality of the earth's reflectance; interferometric monitor for greenhouse gases; improved limb atmospheric spectrometer; and retroreflector in space.

HISTORICAL
The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Level 2.5 high-resolution merged ocean wind vectors and sigma-0 in 25 km wind vector cell (WVC) swaths contain daily data from ascending and descending passes.
Wind vectors are accurate to within 2 m/s (vector speed) and 20 degrees (vector direction).
Wind vectors are not considered valid in rain contaminated regions; rain flags and precipitation information are not provided.
Data is flagged where measurements are either missing or ambiguous.
In the presence of land or sea ice winds values are set to 0, and sigma-0 values are preserved where measurements are available.
This is the most up-to-date version, which designates the final phase of calibration, validation and science data processing, which was completed in November of 1998, on behalf of the JPL NSCAT Project; wind vectors are processed using the NSCAT-2 geophysical model function.
