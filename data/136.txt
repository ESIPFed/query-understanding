Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research   Environments
The Poseidon-2 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the JASON-1 mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionospheric correction.
The Poseidon-2 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.
The JMR mreasures teh sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz and 34.0 GHz) to provide the total water vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement and is a redundant channel on the JMR.
The 18.7 GHz channel provides a correction for wind-induced effects in the sea surface background emissions, and the 34.0 GHz channel provides a correction for cloud liquid water.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.
A satellite altimeter consists of a transmitter that sends out very sharp pulses, a sensitive receiver to record the pulse after it is reflected from the sea surface, and an accurate clock to note the time interval between transmission and reception.
Examples of satellite altimeters used in the remote sensing of ocean surface height,  wave height and wind speed are Seasat, Geosat and Topex/Poseidon.

The TMR measures the sea surface microwave brightness temperatures at three frequencies (18 GHz, 21 GHz and 37 GHz) to provide the total water-vapor content in the troposphere along the altimeter beam.
The 21 GHz channel is the primary channel for water-vapor measurement.
It is redundant (21A and 21B).
The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover, respectively in the water-vapor measurement.
TMR data are sent to CNES for processing along with their altimeter data.
The measurements are combined to obtain the error in the satellite range measurements caused by pulse delay due to the water vapor.
The Poseidon-3 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the OSTM mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionoshperic correction.
The Poseidon-3 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.

Climate Data Record
Jason-1, the TOPEX/POSEIDON follow-on, is an oceanography mission to study global ocean circulation, improve climate predictions, and monitor events such as El Nino conditions.
It is a joint mission between CNES, the French space agency, and NASA, the U.S. space agency.

It is a joint mission between CNES, the French space agency, and NASA, the U.S. space agency.
A combined mission of the U.S. and French Space Agencies designed to make substantial contributions to our understanding of global ocean dynamics by making precise and accurate observations of the oceanic topography for three to five years using radar altimeters on a well-tracked satellite.

DELAY_MODE
This dataset contains along track geo-referenced Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2 (depending on time period) merged into a single mean reference orbit.
All biases and cross-calibrations have been applied to the data so SSHA are consistent between satellites to form a single climate data record.
Altimeter data from the multi-mission Geophysical Data Records (GDRs) are interpolated to a common reference orbit facilitating direct time series analysis of the geo-referenced SSH.
The data are in netCDF format.
Each file consists of one cycle of data, which is approximately 10 days long.
Cycle 001 coincides with cycle 001 of TOPEX/Poseidon (September 25-October 3, 1992).
