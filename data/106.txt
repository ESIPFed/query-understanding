The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-purpose habitable spacecraft in low-earth orbit.
The ISS-RapidScat instrument is a speedy and cost-effective replacement for NASA's QuikScat Earth satellite, which monitored ocean winds to provide essential measurements used in weather predictions, including hurricane monitoring.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains the ISS-RapidScat on Level 2A 12.5 km science data record, which provides surface-flagged sigma-0 in 12.5 km Wind Vector Cells processed using the pulse "slice" Sigma-0 data provided by the Level 1B dataset.
Due to the circular scan of the RapidScat instrument the expected number of Sigma-0 cells per WVC is not constant.
To minimize the L2A data volume, the Sigma-0 cell data are stored as "lists" for each WVC row, with each list indexed by a "cell_index" array to indicate the cross-track WVC membership of the data.
Each cell is then checked for land or ice and flagged accordingly.
Attenuation corrections for each Sigma-0 measurement are also provided.
Data are provided in single-orbit files in HDF-4 format.
RapidScat is a Ku-band dual beam circular rotating scatterometer retaining much of the same hardware and functionality of QuikSCAT, with exception of the antenna sub-system and digital interface to the International Space Station (ISS) Columbus module, which is where RapidScat is mounted.
The NASA mission is officially referred to as ISS-RapidScat.
Unlike QuikSCAT, ISS-RapidScat is not in sun-synchronous orbit, and flies at roughly half the altitude with a low inclination angle that restricts data coverage to the tropics and mid-latitude regions; the extent of latitudinal coverage stretches from approximately 56 degrees North to 56 degrees South.
Furthermore, there is no consistent local time of day retrieval.
