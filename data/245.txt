SeaWinds on ADEOS-II
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.
The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) is an eight-frequency, total-power passive microwave radiometer with dual polarization (except two vertical channels in the 50GHz band).

The second Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II) was as a NASDA/NASA/JPL partner mission launched on December 14, 2002.
By April 10, 2003 the SeaWinds scattorometer on ADEOS-II began to provide science quality measurements to derive ocean surface wind velocity observations.
ADEOS-II suffered a premature power failure on October 24, 2003, which resulted in the termination of the ADEOS-II mission.
SeaWinds on ADEOS-II provided the same 90aily global ice-free ocean coverage as QuikSCAT, allowing for a tandem collection of high quality wind vector observations for more than 6 months.

This dataset is designed to compliment the SeaWinds on ADEOS-II Level 3 ocean surface wind vector dataset through the inclusion of AMSR corrections and precipitation rates.
Data is provided daily and partitioned according to ascending and descending passes; where multiple passes occur over a given point, data from the most recent pass over-writes the earlier (adjacent) pass.
Wind vectors are accurate to within 2 m/s (vector speed) and 20 degrees (vector direction).
Rain flags are provided for each wind vector cell to assist in identifying potential rain contamination.
This product utilizes JPL's most up-to-date calibration, validation, and science data processing from the QSCAT-1/F13 geophysical model function, adopted in July of 2006.
