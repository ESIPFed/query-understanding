SeaWinds on ADEOS-II
SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

The second Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II) was as a NASDA/NASA/JPL partner mission launched on December 14, 2002.
By April 10, 2003 the SeaWinds scattorometer on ADEOS-II began to provide science quality measurements to derive ocean surface wind velocity observations.
ADEOS-II suffered a premature power failure on October 24, 2003, which resulted in the termination of the ADEOS-II mission.
SeaWinds on ADEOS-II provided the same 90aily global ice-free ocean coverage as QuikSCAT, allowing for a tandem collection of high quality wind vector observations for more than 6 months.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains Level 2B science-quality ocean surface wind vector retrievals from the SeaWinds on ADEOS-II scatterometer.
The retrievals are provided on a non-uniform grid within the swath at 25 km pixel resolution.
Each L2B file corresponds to a specific orbital revolution (rev) number, which begins at the southernmost point of the ascending orbit.
The granule metadata is consistent with the QuikSCAT L2B dataset, with exception of the amsr_rain_indicator provided by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instrument aboard the ADEOS-II spacecraft.
Also, the wvc_quality_flag utilizes bits 2-6 for AMSR-related data quality assessment; these bits are left empty in the QuikSCAT L2B wvc_quality_flag variable.
An ASCII inline quality report (Q2B) has been generated for each L2B file; each Q2B file provides statistics of various quality elements pertaining to the processing of a specific L2B file.
This is the official dataset produced by the QuikSCAT Project through the SeaWinds Processing and Analysis Center (SeaPAC).
