Every two days, under all weather and cloud conditions, NSCAT measured wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the Earth's ice-free oceans.
NSCAT used six antenna beams to scan two wide bands of ocean, one on each side of the instrument's orbital path.
NSCAT transmited short pulses of microwave energy to probe ocean surfaces and then measured the reflected or backscattered power.
Variations in the magnitude of this backscattered power are caused by changes in small (centimeter-sized), wind-driven waves.
Using a method called Doppler processing, the measured backscattered power was separated into cells at specific locations on Earth's surface.

NSCAT
The ADvanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) launched in August 1996, was a joint international cooperative program to contribute to global environmental monitoring.
ADEOS had the following instrumentation onboard: advanced visible near infrared radiometer; ocean color and temperature scanner; NASA Scatterometer; total ozone mapping spectrometer; polarization and directionality of the earth's reflectance; interferometric monitor for greenhouse gases; improved limb atmospheric spectrometer; and retroreflector in space.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Level 2 ocean wind vector ambiguity overlay files for the NSCAT MGDR version 2 dataset, referenced for 25 km wind vector cells (WVC).
The dataset is derived from the results of a study which used a 2-D variational analysis method (VAM) to select a wind solution from the NSCAT ambiguous winds (Hoffman et al.
2003).
Hoffman et al.
chose the ambiguity closest in direction to the VAM surface wind analysis.
No ambiguity was chosen for poor quality wind vector cells (WVCs).
ECMWF analyses were used as the background field for the VAM.
Their choice of ambiguity selection is compared with that of JPL, which used a median filter initialized with NCEP analysis fields.
Ambiguity selection is changed in ~5% of the dataset, often improving the depiction of meteorological features where the surface wind is strongly curved or sheared.
See Hoffman et al.
(2003) for more on the method and results.
Additional work by Henderson et al.
(2003) compares the results of median filtering (JPL) vs. the 2d-VAR method (Hoffman et al., 2003) using 51 days of NSCAT data, supplemented by the NCEP 1000 hPa wind analyses as background fields.
