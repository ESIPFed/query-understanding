The TRSR isa an advanced codeless sixteen-channel Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver developed bye the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
The on-board package is comprised of dual redunedant TRSR units and choke ring antennae.
The GPS data are intended to provide supplementary positioning data in support of the POD function and/or to improve gravity field models.
The Poseidon-3 altimeter, operating at 13.575 GHz (Ku band) and 5.3 GHz (C band), is the primary sensor for the OSTM mission.
The measurements made at the two frequencies are combined to obtain measurements of the altimeter range, wind speed, significant wave height, and the ionoshperic correction.
The Poseidon-3 package consists of dual redundant altimeter units each of which has low mass and low power consumption.

OSTM, the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-2 follow-on, is an oceanographic mission to study global ocean circulation, improve climate predictions and monitor events such as El Nino conditions.
It is a joint mission between CNES, NASA, NOAA and EUMETSAT.

The Operational Geophysical Data Records (OGDR) files from the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM)/Jason-2 contain altimeter data, with a precision orbit of 10 cm accuracy, provided approximately 3-5 hours after data collection.
The instruments on OSTM make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter range, significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind speed), ionospheric electron content (derived by a simple formula), tropospheric water content, mean sea surface, Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA), and position relative to the GPS satellite constellation.
These data are distributed by NOAA NODC (National Ocean Data Center).
