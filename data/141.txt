In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships.
The AVHRR is a radiation-detection imager that can be used for remotely determining cloud cover and the surface temperature.
Note that the term surface can mean the surface of the Earth, the upper surfaces of clouds, or the surface of a body of water.

In situ SST data from drifting and moored buoys, and ships at various depths.
The POES satellite system offers the advantage of daily global coverage, with morning and afternoon orbits that deliver global data, for improvement of weather forecasting.
The information received includes cloud cover, storm location, temperature, and heat balance in the earth's atmosphere.

NEAR_REAL_TIME
A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) global Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on a 0.25 degree grid at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.
This product uses optimal interpolation (OI) by interpolating and extrapolating SST observations from different sources, resulting in a smoothed complete field.
The sources of data are satellite (AVHRR) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change over.
At the marginal ice zone, sea ice concentrations are used to generate proxy SSTs.
A preliminary version of this file is produced in near-real time (1-day latency), and then replaced with a final version after 2 weeks.
Note that this is the AVHRR-ONLY (AVHRR-OI), available from September 1, 1981, but there is a companion SST product that includes microwave satellite data, available from June 2002.
