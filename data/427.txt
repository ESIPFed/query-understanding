SeaWinds is a Ku-band (13.4 GHz) Scatterometer which features a single circular scanning dish antenna to provide pencil-beam measurements, as opposed to the common fan beam design as seen with other spaceborne scatterometers.
The pencil-beam design has several key advantages over the more common fan beam design: higher signal-to-noise ratio, smaller size, and superior coverage.
The SeaWinds single antenna utilizes twin offset feeds, thus providing two pencil-beam footprint paths with an elliptical sampling footprint of approximately 25 km (in azimuth) by 37 km (in look/range direction); these pencil beams have opposing polarizations (i.e., vertical and horizontal), thus achieving dual-polarization.
The SeaWinds instrument provides a full 1800 km-wide swath coverage (including the nadir region), which allows for a nominal daily measurement coverage of 90% over the ice-free oceans.

SeaWinds on ADEOS-II Level 3 Sigma-0 Local-Time-of-Day Browse Datasets
The second Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II) was as a NASDA/NASA/JPL partner mission launched on December 14, 2002.
By April 10, 2003 the SeaWinds scattorometer on ADEOS-II began to provide science quality measurements to derive ocean surface wind velocity observations.
ADEOS-II suffered a premature power failure on October 24, 2003, which resulted in the termination of the ADEOS-II mission.
SeaWinds on ADEOS-II provided the same 90aily global ice-free ocean coverage as QuikSCAT, allowing for a tandem collection of high quality wind vector observations for more than 6 months.

HISTORICAL
This dataset contains polar-stereographic-gridded Sigma-0 retrievals over the Arctic Polar region from SeaWinds on ADEOS-II retrievals subsetted and averaged twice daily at the local time-of-day (LTOD); local times are approximately mid-day (08:00 to 16:00 local) and evening (16:00 to 24:00 local).
The eight hour interval at each LTOD reference of mid-day vs. evening corresponds to the natural boundaries of time separation within the data at polar latitudes.
Hence, mid-day and evening are used as approximations for the LTOD reference, where the actual LTOD may vary within the respective 8 hour interval.
This dataset is generated using a Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) technique developed by Dr. David Long at Brigham Young University (BYU); the processed files are therefore known as SIR files.
These SIR files were also used to generate a complimentary dataset of GIF images meant for browse purposes only and is available here: http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/SEAWINDS_BYU_L3_OW_SIGMA0_ARCTIC_POLAR-STEREOGRAPHIC_BROWSE_IMAGES_LTOD.
The SeaWinds scatterometer scans at two nominal incidence angles, 46 degrees and 54.1 degrees, corresponding to the inner and outer beams respectively.
The inner beam is horizontally polarized while the outer beam is vertically polarized.
The SIR files are separated according to polarization.
For example, one SIR file for a particular day and LTOD will contain the gridded average Sigma-0 values for the horizontally polarized L1B retrievals, while the other will contain those from the vertically polarized L1B retrievals.
This dataset is generated by the Scatterometer Climate Record Pathfinder (SCP) project at BYU.
