Improve Earth Data Discovery through Deep Query Understanding (ESIP Incubator project)

The goals of this project include:
* Create an open-source query understanding solution for Earth sciences that fills the aforementioned intent gap in Earth data discovery;
* Provide a proof-of-concept for deep learning and natural language processing in Earth data/knowledge discovery that can be shared with the broader Earth Science Community, including ESIP and interested scientists worldwide through presentations and one or more papers;
* Implement technologies or activities furthering ESIP goals of Discovery, Earth Science Cyber-infrastructure, as well as Semantic Technologies
